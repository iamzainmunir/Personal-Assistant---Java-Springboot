# Personal-Assistant-Java-Springboot
Practice project using micro services for personal assistant App.


Project Idea: "Smart Personal Assistant Platform"
Overview
Create a web application that provides a personalized assistant for users. The assistant can handle:
    • User authentication and authorization.
    • Task management.
    • Natural language queries.
    • Recommendations based on user behavior (AI-driven).
    • Notifications and reminders.

Core Features
    1. User Management
        ◦ Authentication: JWT-based login and signup.
        ◦ Authorization: Role-based access control (admin, regular user).
        ◦ Profile Management: Edit profile details, add preferences, etc.
    2. Task Management
        ◦ CRUD operations for tasks (to-do lists, reminders, etc.).
        ◦ Task categorization (work, personal, etc.).
        ◦ Set due dates with notifications.
    3. AI-Powered Natural Language Processing (NLP)
        ◦ Chat interface where users can type queries like:
            ▪ "Add a meeting with John tomorrow at 10 AM."
            ▪ "What tasks are due today?"
        ◦ Use AI to parse queries and perform actions.
    4. Recommendation System
        ◦ Suggest tasks based on past behavior.
        ◦ Recommend content, e.g., articles or resources based on user interests.
    5. Integration with External APIs
        ◦ Weather API for displaying weather in reminders.
        ◦ Calendar API for syncing tasks.
    6. Real-Time Notifications
        ◦ Use WebSocket or server-sent events (SSE) for real-time task reminders.
    7. Admin Dashboard
        ◦ View system usage, user analytics, etc.
        ◦ Manage user data (delete inactive users, etc.).

Learning Goals Covered

Database Design
Each microservice has its own database (Database per service pattern):
Microservice
Database
Schema/Details
User Service
PostgreSQL/MongoDB
Users, roles, preferences.
Task Management Service
PostgreSQL/MongoDB
Tasks, categories, due dates.
NLP Service
NoSQL (Optional)
Caches AI models or processed queries.
Recommendation Service
Redis or PostgreSQL
User behavior and recommendations.
Notification Service
PostgreSQL/Redis
Scheduled notifications and real-time data.

Factors to Determine Microservices Count
    1. Scalability: Services like NLP, recommendation, and notifications can be resource-heavy and benefit from independent scaling.
    2. Fault Isolation: Separate services ensure that a failure in one doesn’t affect the entire system.
    3. Development Independence: Each service can be built and deployed independently, aiding teams working in parallel.
    4. Future Extensibility: For instance, if you plan to add voice-based interactions, the NLP service can handle it without affecting other services.

Final Recommendation
Start with 6-8 microservices, as outlined above. You can merge or split services later based on system needs and traffic. For example:
    • If traffic is low, merge User Service and Task Management Service.
    • If the recommendation logic grows complex, split it into multiple smaller services.
